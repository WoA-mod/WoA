##### Bookmark Description #####

ENG_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "The Guerra Mondiale left the United Kingdom in ruins. Huge territorial losses and economic depression destroyed the once powerful empire. A military coup by Kitchener could not prevent the secession of a Scottish Workers’ Republic and the de facto end to a united Great Britain.  By 1936, J.F.C. Fuller has come to power in the ruins of England. A movement for  cultural renewal in the Anglo-Saxon revivalist ‘Folkloric Ednewing’ is being spearheaded by the regime, but the old yearning for parliamentary rule remains. All the while, England keeps a steely gaze across the seas towards her old enemies of the USA and Germany, and plots."

##### Ideas #####
ENG_a_kingdom_without_a_king:0 "A Kingdom without a King"
ENG_a_kingdom_without_a_king_desc:0 "Since George V's death, Edward VIII has been de jure king, but that has been no fanfare or announcement from the state. While there is no King, can we truly call ourselves the United Kingdom?"
ENG_military_government:0 "Military Government"
ENG_military_government_desc:0 "The fact that the government has been ruled by the British Army since 1923 means that doctrine is meticulously planned out with the resources of the Civil Service. However, harsh martial law has put people off from joining the army."
ENG_legacy_of_the_guerra_mondiale:0 "Legacy of the Guerra Mondiale"
ENG_legacy_of_the_guerra_mondiale_desc:0 "The crippling famine and economic disaster that struck the British Isles with the combined German and American blockade still has not entirely been forgotten. The military government must spend large amounts of its efforts on rebuilding and maintaining food output."
ENG_british_constitutionalism:0 "British Constitutionalism"
ENG_british_constitutionalism_desc:0 "Despite a radical government, the historic British record of parliamentary rule and constitutional government means that pro-democracy sentiments still lurk beneath the surface of the military junta, even if the military government itself will not tolerate such ideas expressing themselves in harmful ways."

#-Fall of X

uknews.100.d:0 "It was announced earlier today by the British Government that their forces had entered the French Capital of Paris. Sporadic Street fighting is continuing throughout the city, however, the majority of French forces have either surrendered or fled its capture.\n\nThe fight continues on elsewhere in the country and across the globe, but many are predicting that the fall of France will happen sooner rather than later – and this time at the hands of the British."
uknews.101.d:0 "The British Government announced today that Imperial forces had entered the German capital city of Berlin. Berliners looked on in shock as British troops marched through the streets. It is said that Union Jacks can already be seen flying high above the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate.\n\nAs the fighting continues throughout the rest of Germany, it is unlikely that the German Government will hold on for much longer. The vanguard of Valkism looks to be on the edge of capitulation."
uknews.102.d:0 "It is being reported today that the Italian capital of Rome has formally surrendered to British forces. Throughout the city fights are still occurring though, as the British Army seeks to push out any remaining Italian resistance. The Italian Government have been safely evacuated, and the British have agreed to allow the Pope to continue his residency.\n\nWith their largest city in enemy hands, the Italians seem set to collapse soon enough."
uknews.103.d:0 "Today, it was confirmed by the British Government that Imperial forces had occupied the American capital of Washington D.C. They stated that - although capturing the city was a great success - it is unknown how much longer it will be before a now seemingly inevitable American collapse. Rumours continue to swirl of a brutal ransack of the city with the White House once more being put to the torch in a repeat of what occurred during the War of 1812.\n\nBritish plans for US occupation are unknown to the world at large. What is known however, is that should the United States surrender then the British Empire will have crushed perhaps one of its most powerful rivals."

ukfate.1.d:0 "After centuries of rivalry, war and destruction, we have finally achieved what many believed impossible; the complete occupation of the French mainland. The British Army has marched triumphantly across the plains of France in their steadfast conquest of a once deadly opponent. It stands to us now to decide what the fate of France shall be."
ukfate.2.d:0 "Today marks a historic victory over the German nation for the second time in less than three decades. Denied in the previous war, today victorious British soldiers march under the Brandenburg Gate through the streets of Berlin. With our great triumph over the Germans, the question remains: What will become of the German nation?"
ukfate.3.d:0 "Victorious British soldiers have conducted a final victory parade through the streets of Rome today, as the Italian Government signed a treaty of unconditional surrender to our Government earlier this week. With our victory over the Italians and the capital of Italy under our firm control we must now decide the future of the Italian nation."
ukfate.4.d:0 "Almost two hundred years have passed since our defeat in the American Rebellion. Since that time the United States have grown immensely powerful, but their strength could not save them from our righteous vengeance. Already British troops march through the streets of the United States' major cities as startled Americans look on in horror.\n\nToday marks a new height in the history of our Empire; we have won the war, now we must win the peace."
