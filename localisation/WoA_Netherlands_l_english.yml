#### Ideas ####
Legacy_Of_Red_Week:0 "Legacy Of The Red Week"
Legacy_Of_Red_Week_desc:0 "While being only brief, Red Week was in no way calm. Modern equipment and arms made short work of the buildings used as hideouts by revolutionaries or army groups. As a result, much of the country’s industrial areas were reduced to rubble as the military and revolutionaries fought for control of them. They must be rebuilt if our country is to recover."
Young_Junta:0 "Young Junta"
Young_Junta_desc:0 "The Junta in its current form has only existed for two months. Still, it provides much needed stability after the terrible events of November. However, the leader of the Junta, General Winkelman, is expected to return to retirement soon. It remains to be seen whether or not this will lead to more stabilization."
