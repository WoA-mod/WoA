bel.1.t:0 "The Belgian Situation"
bel.1.d:0 "Belgium has been a struggling nation for much of the 20th century. With the end of the Guerra Mondiale, Belgium found itself ruled by a German King and going by the name of Flanders-Wallonia, with the royal family in exile and the nation a mere shadow of its former glory. However with the second declaration of independence in 1931, Belgium finally found itself turning the downturn upside down. With the wide coalition of Liberals, Catholics and Socialists, Belgium was finally recovering from economic downfall and years of inefficient rule. But many do threaten the status quo. In the nation many still see Albert as the True king, as opposed to his son, Leopold III. Many rumors also has gone around saying Leopold seeks to take power for himself. Nationalist elements have risen, with the leading figure Leon Degrelle at the helm. However for now, the Belgian situation remains peaceful, with upcoming elections later this year."
bel.1.a:0 "The Belgian Lion Roars!"
bel.2.t:0 "The Coalition Breaks"
bel.2.d:0 "After months of arguing amongst the Belgian Labour party, Catholic Party, and the Liberal Party, the coalition has split today. Hundreds of thousands across the country now worry for the future of stability in Belgium, with many fleeing to more radical left and right wing parties. Rumors of the BWP forming a new coalition with the Belgian Communist party, as well as a far right coalition potentially making a move in the next elections spread across the nation, bringing fear for the many thousands of citizens. However for now we must wait and see what folds in these daring times. "
bel.2.a:0 "Belgium is on a tightrope"
bel.3.t:0 "The King’s Coup"
bel.3.d:0 "What started as a bright and sunny day, has become a very controversial day for Belgium. Today, King Leopold, after meeting with the Army and with the National Royalist Movement, marched onto the Belgian Federal Parliament. The goals of the King and the other members coup originates from the recently formed socialist coalition, between the Belgian Labour Party and the Belgian Communist Party. King Leopold has given out a speech, stating that the suspension of the parliament is only temporary for when the government transitions from the socialist government to a more stable government, and that in the following days stability will be restored to Belgium. Many criticize this move as to be a play by the king to strengthen his governmental powers, while many see it as the end of a growing socialist threat and the start of a better and brighter Belgium. We must only wait and see how things play out."
bel.3.a:0 "So this is how liberty dies"
bel.4.t:0 "REX Party Protests Elections"
bel.4.d:0 "With the Elections concluded, the Rexist party, led by Leon Degrelle, has protested the result. They state that the result is unfair, and that a recount is needed, however, we cannot simply do this. Our current government cannot allow for instabillity for the sake of the nation, its time we take actions against this growing threat to the Kingdom. But what action do we take? Some propose a compromise with the party, while others suggest a more authoritarian method against them."
bel.4.a:0 "Let us Try to Compromise with the Rexists"
bel.4.b:0 "We cannot allow instabillity! Declare Martial Law!"
bel.5.t:0 "The Rexist Conspiracy"
bel.5.d:0 "With the Snap elections of 37 done our new government has discovered something shocking, King Leopold III was discovered to be in contact with Rexist Leader Leon Degrelle and was planning a coup, that is until the arrestment and disbandment of parliament. With this information now in public hands public outcry against this betrayal from the king has swept across the nation. Police now move in on Leopold’s location to put him on house arrest, but the scar he has put in Belgium will always Linger."
bel.5.a:0 "You were supposed to support the people! Not betray them!"
bel.6.t:0 "The Royal Question"
bel.6.d:0 "Now that Leopold III has been put on house arrest and the Rexist threat has been dealt with, the question on the monarch stands, what shall be done about Leopold III? Many people advocate for his father returning as king, while others think Leopold deserves a second chance, and finally some belive the line should be continued under Baudouin, with prince Charles as regent."
bel.6.a:0 "King Albert Rules Once More!"
bel.6.b:0 "Give Leopold a second chance!"
bel.6.c:0 "Prince Charles shall serve as regent for Baudouin I!"
