POLITICS_JUAN_LECHIN_OQUENDO_DESC:0 "Juan Lechín was a communist revolutionary that lived most of his life in exile in Peru. After the Great South American War, he moved back after the Bolivian defeat, and was one of the most important politicians to support the Bolivian 1931 General Worker Strikes, In 1933 after Gustavo Navarro had to back down from leadership after health problems, he was elected by the general council. His prime objective is to influence Peru and stabilish a new Peru-Bolivian Confederation, but like an union of socialist republics. He also supports every anti-chilean sentiment and all chileans living in Bolivia were either killed or exiled. He started the Five Year Plan and he was the one to declare the annual payments to the chileans dead."
