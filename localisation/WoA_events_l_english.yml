soviet.1.t:0 "Russia in 1936"
soviet.1.d:0 "Following the abdication of Tsar Nicholas and his subsequent escape to Britain in 1917, Russia was ruled by the Provisional Government, to which the Petrograd Soviet pledged allegiance on certain conditions.  The Germans denied Lenin’s request to return to the motherland as communism was on the rise in Danubia.  After a four month general-strike-turned-armed-revolt, protesting the ongoing war, and under pressure from the Petrograd Soviet, the Duma ruled to make peace with the Germans.  The Treaty of Pinsk saw Russia lose Ukraine, the Baltics, Finland, Poland, and Kamchatka, and in the subsequent turmoil Belarus and Turkestan.  Russia recovered, in in 1920 a constituent assembly was called to redraw the constitution.  Russia is now ruled by the its president and the Joint Assembly, a two house parliament composed of the Duma and Grand Soviet, successor to the Petrograd Soviet.  The 1925 Assembly election would determine the future of Russia in no small part.  The Bolshevik rhetoric had been largely discredited as many served in the first Assembly, Duma and Soviet, and their most prominent figure, Lenin remained in Switzerland under house arrest.  From this the Mensheviks started to rise in popularity, as do the Kadets.  1930 brings similar yields, however many still hold secret allegiances to Bolshevik faction that are not being realized in this time of relative peace.  The Soviet does most of the day-to-day running of the country, and the Duma handles larger policy decisions, like multi-year infrastructure expansion projects.  Free speech is relatively well known by 1936, as there is almost always someone in government you makes sure their supporters receive the freedom.  Many tsarists must hid their allegiances, however.  Labor unions flourish and have their own seats on the Soviet.  Many more radical reforms have been stopped in the Duma, however, as they remain more conservative.  The 1935 elections have brought the winds of change.  Following the second Byelorussian war, Russia has seen a radicalization of politics, and both Bolsheviks and Populists are on the rise.  More moderate parties attempt to hold steadfast as Russia enters a new age.  How will you guide the motherland through this troublesome time?"
