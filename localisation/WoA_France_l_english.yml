FRA_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Following their disastrous loss in the Guerra Mondiale, France was forced into an economic union with Germany, whom also retained a tight control over the politics and government of the nation. This led to a socialist revolt in February 1919, and while it was swiftly crushed, the scars of war have still never left France. The year is now 1936. After the war a government was formed under war hero Philippe Petain and the Democratic Alliance party, which has kept a tenous peace, however as the ailing Prussian giant grows weaker by the day, France may soon find itself in yet another war they just cant win..."

fra.1.t:0 "An Introduction to France"
fra.1.d:0 "By late 1918 France was all but defeated, the Germans having taken Paris, and was rewarded for all their efforts with their triumphant enemies handing to them what was potentially one of the most humiliating treaties in the history of mankind. The Treaty of Ludwigsburg stipulated that France was to cede a strip along the German border, as well as allow a permenant German diplomatic mission to advise the government on all future matters of military and foreign policy. Their army was to be crippled to a size that would never again be effective in a true European land war, and outrageous monetary reparations were forced upon the French people, a debt which they were by no metric able to pay. Although only a small consolation, they were able to retain most of their African colonial posessions because of German fears that the already bloated Mittelafrika would be unable to take the overextension of all the new territory seized from the British and Belgians. \n However this was not an end to France's woes, as in February 1919 a Labour strike at a factory in starving Western Paris erupted into a full-blown nationwide revolt against the German occupation in the wake of the war, as the Treaty was still being finalised and implemented. While the revolt was by all means a failure, having been quickly stomped down by the German boot, the mass internments and execution of leaders after, as well as the permenant military garrison in Paris, left the nation scarred and divided. \n A new Fourth Republic was formed in January 1920 under war hero Phillippe Petain and the Democratic Alliance party, which has managed to just barely take success in each subsequent election despite many seeing them as too willing to give into German influence, and some critics have even accused them of colluding with the Germans to manipulate the election results in order to keep the most left-wing legal party, the PRRRS, out of government. Now the years of stress have taken their toll on Petain, with many predicting that he may be forced to step down soon in favour of a more popular candidate in wake of his failure to deal with the aftermath of the Great Depression, and the noted rise of extremism under his rule."
fra.1.a:0 "How ever will France survive?"

fra.2.t:0 "The Paris Strike"
fra.2.d:0 "All across Paris a general strike has been called by the banned SFIO party along with a number of other left-wing organisations in the city and surrounding area, in commemeration of of the failed 1919 revolution. At 11am they marched out of the factories, red flags held aloft, and proceeded to congregate on the Place de la Concorde. \n A number of speeches were given to the crowd by leading trade unionists, calling for the release of political prisoners and for people to reject the accusedly 'corrupt, German-ran, bourgeoise government'. Amongst the crowd were a number of banners depicting such socialist heros as Marx, Engels, Kun and Lenin. \n It seems that after the speeches, the crowd has now begun its planned march along the Avenue des Champs-Elysees."
fra.2.a:0 "Mon Dieu, les sauvages!"

fra.3.t:0 "A Turn for the Worst"
fra.3.d:0 "As the march continues further and further along, gathering support as it goes, it seems to have reaached a roaadblock. The idea was that they would reach the police blockade set up by us, however it seems that a mob of ACA Blueshirts, along with a number of of other far-right protesters and veteran's organisations, have formed a along their route in an attempt to block them. The far-right has seen a noted rise as of late, evidently inspired by, and even accudesly funded by, Fassa's Italy. The main body of them are disgruntled veterans and nationalists angry at the government's policy of appeasement to German influence, however the latest and most popular manifestation of these far-right leagues, the Action Catholic Antique, has managed to gain a great deal of support by appealing to both the authoritarian and conservative elements of society. As the two groups grow closer togethr, it seems like a skirmish could break out, what shall we do?"
fra.3.a:0 "That's enough! Send in the Police!"
fra.3.b:0 "I think provoking this would only make things worse"

fra.4.t:0 "The Crackdown"
fra.4.d:0 "After sending in the Police Nationale, armed officers have now begun moving in to disperse both illegal protests, arresting people left and right. While some violent methods have been used, thankfully none were seriously hurt on our side. Our officers failed to find any high-ranking leaders of the march involved in causing the violence, so most of those imprisoned were ultimately released the next day after a lengthy interrogation."
fra.4.a:0 "I think we're lucky things didn't get too out of hand"

fra.5.t:0 "The Path of Most Resistance"
fra.5.d:0 "We have elected to hold back our troops now, as to charge the enemy now before they play their hand would be both a foolhardy and potentially dangerous move for our brave and patriotic officers. It would seem that now, after a long standoff, some fighting and limited skirmishes have broken out between the opposing sides, and already a number have been injured in the conflict. Neither side has fully committed themselves however, not wishing to seem like the instigators of yet another clash. Most within the police and army are now saying that it is the time to intervene in order to prevent even greater bloodshed."
fra.5.a:0 "Send them in!"
fra.5.b:0 "Wait for it… wait for it..."

fra.6.t:0 "A Triumph of the Worker"
fra.6.d:0 "It seems like our plan to have the protesters fight each other has backfired spectacularly. After a brief conflict, the Communists were able to easily overpower the Nationalists, continuing on their planned route through Paris with little resistance before dispersing once they reached their planned end."
fra.6.a:0 "Most unfortunate indeed…"

fra.7.t:0 "In Defence of the Faith"
fra.7.d:0 "It seems like our plan to have the protesters fight each other has backfired spectacularly. After a brief conflict, the Nationalists were able to hold back the front lines of the Communist march for long enough that they, with a small amount of Police encouragement, were eventually forced to cancel their demonstration and disperse."
fra.7.a:0 "At least no one died..."

fra.8.t:0 "As Good As Can Be Expected"
fra.8.d:0 "Despite much doubt, it seems like our plan has worked, the Communists and Nationalists clashed somewhat with each other, but eventually they reached a stalemate and our police were able to move in and quickly send them both retreating from our streets. This swift victory has made us look rather good indeed to the press, and will hopefully restore some small amount of public trust in us."
fra.8.a:0 "Genius!"
