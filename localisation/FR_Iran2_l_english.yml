#### EVENTS ####

iran.0.t:0 "The State of Iran in 1936"
iran.0.d:0 "For many years, Persia, now referred to as Iran, has been in a decline. While the modernization of the country began in the 1800s, British and Russian influence also began to grow. At the end of the century, many in Persia believed that their rulers were beholden to foreign interests. At the start of the 20th century, the state, then known as Persia, became a constitutional monarchy after the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Elections were introduced in Persia soon after. \n\nDuring the Great War, Persia announced its neutrality in the conflict. This did not stop the Ottomans from invading the country, however. At this time, parts of the country was under the influence and control of Russia, and Russian forces were present. In Iranian Azerbaijan, clashes began between Ottoman and Russian forces, the latter of them were aided by Assyrian and Armenian volunteer units. However, with the advent of the Russian Revolution, the Ottomans gained the upper hand in Persia. Under the war, many thousands of the Assyrian and Armenian population in Persia was massacred by Ottoman troops. British forces were also occupying parts of the country during the war. The occupying forces were seen as a major cause for the Great Persian famine of 1917 - 1919 that struck the country. \n\nAfter the war, the British tried to establish a protectorate in Iran, but was unsuccessful. While the war was over, the population of Iran was quite rebellious. In 1922, a socialist rebellion rose up capturing Teheran and forcing the Qajar royal family to flee from the country. But before a socialist republic could be established, the majority of the Persian army, under the leadership of Reza Khan and with British support, crushed the rebellion. While some believed that this would lead to the restoration of the royal family, the military took over under the leadership of Reza Khan. Like that, the age of Persian monarchs was over. \n\nThe new military regime modernized Persia and built railways throughout the country. But while all of this happened, the Persian military was in a fight to silence socialist elements in Persia. Many conservative voices were not happy either when the regime worked to separate religion and state, and adopting Western clothes. In 1933, the country changed its official name to Iran. \n\nThe last 20 years have also seen the regime balancing between favoring both the British Empire and Iranian nationalists. With rebellions rising up in India, it remains to be seen if it is time for Iran to continue under the military regime, adopt a more democratic system, or be consumed by socialist or nationalist revolutions."

Whatever if he dies or not, Iran needs a new commander to lead the country.
