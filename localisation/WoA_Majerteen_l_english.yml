majer.1.t:0 "A terrible rivalry"
majer.1.d:0 "On a normal sleepy morning such as this one, villagers would wake up to the sounds of joyful playing, amiable chatter, and livestock wandering around the lush surroundings. This morning, however, was broken by the sound of gunfire, screaming, and sickening thuds. Where children once loitered, blood spills out of an unmoving carcass. Where people once took a rest and talked, one man rests on top of another, strangling the life out of him. Where crops once grew, the belongings of many families were being rounded up and stolen. \n\n This scene is all too familiar for many. Despite our superior military edge, our rivals continue to cross our undefended borders and strike deep into our lands, raping, pillaging, and killing as they see fit. Many are pressuring the Sultan to begin work on solving this, but many different suggestions have been brought forth by advisors and aristocrats.  \n\n Some suggest establishing a regular patrol to protect border settlements and fight raiders back before they strike. Other advisors claim that the best solution is to begin the tedious work of contructing border fortifictions to augment our military's power. Others suggest instead funneling our resources to prepare for a direct and total invasion of our neighboring sultans to eradicate the problem once at for all."
