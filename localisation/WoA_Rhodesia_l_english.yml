RHO_WHISPERS_OF_ANTIQUITY_DESC:0 "Independent Rhodesia did not have the birth its founding fathers would have desired. Rushed Dominion-status with the collapse of the British government and now standing adrift in the world, Rhodesia and its sister-state in Bechuanaland are tied together and stuck in between the rock of the Southern African Republic and the hard place of German Mittelafrika. Only Portuguese Moçambique is a true friend and ally. While the small economy is augmented by skilled English settlers fleeing Afrikaner and German political rule, race relations are increasingly an issue and the state is alone on the world stage. The years to come are surely turbulent for the fledgling African state."

##### Ideas #####
RHO_breadbasket_of_africa:0 "Breadbasket of Africa"
RHO_breadbasket_of_africa_desc:0 "Our exports of wheat, tobacco and corn are renowned and have earned us the title of ‘Breadbasket of Africa’, as well as substantial amounts of cash for our fertile crops."
RHO_royal_rhodesia_flying_corps:0 "Royal Rhodesia Flying Corps"
RHO_royal_rhodesia_flying_corps_desc:0 "Led by Arthur Harris, our military has adapted with gusto to the new battleground of war – the skies. Furthermore, with our isolated position we have had to invest heavily in aviation infrastructure in order to maintain imports and exports. Thus, the nation is well prepared for a battle in the sky."
RHO_rhodesians_never_die:0 "Rhodesians Never Die"
RHO_rhodesians_never_die_desc:0 "’Cause we're all Rhodesians and we'll fight through thick and thin, \nWe'll keep our land a free land, stop the enemy coming in. \nWe'll keep them north of the Zambezi till that river's running dry, \nThis mighty land will prosper for Rhodesians never die!"
RHO_poor_higher_education:0 "Poor Higher Education"
RHO_poor_higher_education_desc:0 "Before the Afrikaner take over in South Africa, the best and brightest of Rhodesia went to Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape. With a hostile government to the south, Rhodesia lacks its own higher education facilities – which must rectified to stay at the forefront of technological progress in the world."
RHO_tribal_divisions:0 "Tribal Divisions"
RHO_tribal_divisions_desc:0 "The internal tribal divisions in our country, chiefly into the large Shona and Matabele tribes, mean that many potential recruits are lost to propaganda and misunderstandings. If we can create a truly multicultural army then we can change this image, and reap the rewards"
