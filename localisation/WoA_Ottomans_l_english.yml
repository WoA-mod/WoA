#tur.1.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire"
#tur.1.d:0 "When [Root.GetNameDef] had joined the Great War on the side of the Central Powers, they had not expected the tough battle and disastrous defeat that followed. The conclusion of the Great War had saw [Root.GetNameDef] nearly dissolve, with the British fanning the flames for Arabian nationalism in the empire’s Arabian vilayets. In addition, when [Root.GetNameDef] was forced to the negotiation table, they were occupied and carved up by the Entente powers – namely Britain, Greece, France, and Italy.\n\nWhat remained of the Ottoman Empire, which was now limited to Anatolia and Constantinople, was forced to accept a government of the Entente’s choosing, with the Sultan as a figurehead. Thus, the Freedom and Entente Party had taken power in the nation, under the guidance of the Entente.\n\nWhat followed after was a revolt by Mustafa Kemal Paşa, a brigadier general in the Ottoman Army, who had sought to kick out the imperialists from Turkey and modernize the nation. A joint Anglo-Greek intervention force ended these dreams, when Mustafa Kemal and his group of revolutionaries were all defeated in a short, but bloody, battle.\n\nEver since the aforementioned event, the Sultan, Abdülmecid II, has managed to hold onto power, with the backing of the Entente. However, the political situation is very turbulent, with factionalism very much prevalent, and may crack at any time..."
