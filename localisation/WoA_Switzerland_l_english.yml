SWI_WHISPERS_OF_ANTIQUITY_DESC:0 "Ever since the first Guerra Mondiale, Switzerland has been in a peculiar position- with rising Swiss German-French tensions and it's neighbouring countries, among whom the revanchist Italy, seeking to reclaim the Roman Empire, and the communist Danubia, are threatening the Swiss ideals and independence. While the Swiss have retained their neutrality since 1815, the world seems to loom into another major conflict and with Switzerland's strategic geopolitical situation, it may again be required to heavily militarize to protect their independence and deter aggression, but with every day, a war seems more and more inevitable."

#### Ideas ####

SWI_bank_act:0 "Swiss Banking Act"
#SWI_bank_act_desc:0 "Signed on December 1st 1933, the Swiss Banking Act was created in an effort to secure the assets of account holders within Switzerland. The act was a reactionary measure against the French intervention in the Rhineland, which saw many foreign assets in the region shut down and their profits siezed. The Banking Act has made it a criminal offense for a bank to reveal the name of an account holder, and proved very effective when both the French and German governments pressed the Swiss to reveal the names of certain accounts which had ties to the industrial Rhine region."

SWI_armed_neutrality:0 "Armed Neutrality"
SWI_armed_neutrality_desc:0 "Ever since the Treaty of Paris in 1815, Switzerland has had the policy of neutrality, which meant not partaking part in any military alliances unless they themselves are attacked and to not allow foreign armies movement through it's land. Despite this, Switzerland is highly militarized and almost every citizen is trained and ready to rise up and defend the nation, in order to make invading it a really unattractive option to most aggressors and maintain Swiss independence."

SWI_army_upkeep_desc:0 "Our highly trained and huge military for a nation our size comes at a cost- during the Guerra Mondiale, keeping our army mobilized and paying all the soldiers caused huge economic problems, and we must be careful not to cause them again- either by limiting our army size, expanding our industry or passing reforms to guarantee economical stability. \nAt the moment, we have no army upkeep costs."

#### Events ####
swi.1.t:0 "State of the Swiss Confederation"
swi.1.d:0 "The modern Swiss state was born in 1891, where our constitution was revised with strong democracy as the most important element. Our foreign policy was born in 1815, where we were officially declared as a neutral state, pinned down in a very strategic geopolitical situation. This has formed our national Swiss identity- independent of culture, it has stood strong. Until now. \n\nWe managed to avoid war and revolution when it was all around us. But was that the right decision? That is the current problem of the modern Swiss society- we put down the French socialists, fearing a Danubian style revolt in 1919 and kept Romandy occupied until the Germans dealt with France- and now, those French socialists are more popular than ever, and as a counter-weight, a new nationalist, far-right, pro-German party has been formed by Eugen Bircher- advocating for a more authoritarian democracy to keep our nation stable and proud. \n\nOur federal and democratic ideals are under threat in home, but outside, it is our sovereignty that we have to be worried about- the new Italian nation, lead by Marco Fassa, has laid a keen eye on our Italian-speaking territory, France seems like it will fall again and their troubles may spread to our borders and the German Empire is in disarray- the situation has never looked so dire for our Confederation. With the 1937 federal elections coming up, our future remains uncertain."
