GER_CAESARREICH_DESC:0 "The German Empire came out as a victor from the Guerra Mondiale, but domestically, it was more of a loss. The war and the following year of 1919, which would be known as the "The Year of Hell", would see Germany rise as a world power, but at a great cost. The strain of maintaining the status quo has allowed the rise of liberals, communists and separatists, which have lead to an unstable political situation in the empire. The Great Depression would also hit Germany hard, and while in 1936 it looks that it is coming to an end, with another war looming over the horizon, the question remains: Will the German Empire live?"
