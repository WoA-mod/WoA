hby.1.d:0 "Due to the Sultan's directions to brutally crush Hawiye clans, hundreds of Hobyo citizens lie dead in fields, forests, puddles, and holes. Villages are being wiped out by the Darod government, and Hawiye clans are fighting back to protect their sovereignty from the Harod government. Villages are fighting other villages, neighbors attacking their own neighbors. The very fabric of the nation is being torn as the government started an avalanche of violence from pent-up racial contempt and tension. \n\nAs villages are being wiped out in an all-consuming fire of racial hatred, Hobyo seems to be hurdling torward a true catastrophe. The government remains adamant that it is necessary to destroy the tribal structure of Hawiye settlements in order to centralize the sultanate into a formidable force. Others demand an immediate end to this policy that caused such terrible and unintentional harm."
