alt_history.1.d:0 "“The Second Commonwealth” is the first novel by Aurore Sand, granddaughter of acclaimed writer George Sand. In it, the central powers defeat and heavily partition the Russian empire only to be defeated by the Entente shortly after. \n\nThe novel is framed as an interview of a veteran of the Guerra Mondiale. While it initially seems to follow actual accounts of the war inconsistencies begin to build until it reveals itself as an alternative history. In this world, the United Kingdom and France choose to separate central and eastern Europe into dozens of separate states so as to hold total control of the continent. Despite this iron grip, internal issues resulting from a harsh war soon take hold of the victors and they are forced to watch their new empires turn against them. \n\nAs chaos unfolds in the west, several baltic nations begin to rapidly industrialize. Waldemar Laurits, a radical futurist, comes to the forefront as the premier leader of a new movement. While the narrator himself claims the man’s plans were insane, the events of the novel indicate Laurits’s strategy of endless progress results in a union of unusually productive nations. This “Commonwealth” is composed of the Baltics, “Ostpreußen”, and Poland. After describing the Commonwealth’s rise the narrator quotes Laurits as saying “The world will progress, or I will progress the world”. \n\nThe novel ends with the interview being interrupted by a Commonwealth declaration of a “Progress Karš” against a monarchist France and Italy, while an aggressively anarchic British coalition begins to mobilise."

alt_history.2.t:0 "James Cowan - Emu Reich"
alt_history.2.d:0 "Kiwi author and historian James Cowan today published an exciting alternative history book known as “Emu Reich”. The events of the tale take place in a shell-shocked Australia, in a timeline where the Guerra Mondiale resulted in a victory for the Russian Empire and an over stretched Australian government is unable to deal with rapidly increasing numbers of emus. The Russian Empire allied itself with the Ottoman Empire to fight in a three-way-war against the Central Powers and the Entente, and while this element has drawn criticism for its lack of historicity and plausibility, it results in a fascinating new geopolitical order in Central Europe, with Russia dominating Poland and Eastern Germany, and the Ottomans returning to the Balkans, finally breaching the gates of Vienna. \n\nFamines rock Australia, and civil society begins to break down in the west of the country, and migrating emus cause mass evacuation of towns. Following the socialist writings of Karl Marx and the pre-existing White Australia policy, an Ethno-Marxist totalitarian dictatorship is established to destroy the pestilent birds and end the instability that threatens Australia. The United Kingdom is unable to deal with its rebellious offspring, seeing crisis at home following the loss of Egypt and many other African colonies to the Constantinople-Moscow Axis. \n\nFrench and German nationalism violently emerges over the 1920s and by the middle of the fourth decade of the century the two states are allied, turning over the old grievances of the Franco-Prussian War to take on the so-called ‘Axis’. The book ends with the Australian government led by Jack Miles declaring official war on the emu plague and a Second Guerra Mondiale breaking out between the Franco-German Alliance and the ‘Axis’ to the east. The title is a play on the empire of Germany and its dominance in Europe, tying in Australia’s own current issues with an over-population of emus and distorting it into a wild fantasy - but it has had rave reviews from some quarters, who insist that in another universe, something like this could have happened."
