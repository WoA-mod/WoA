##### Events #####
FRA.council.1.t:0 "France invites us to join the Entente military alliance"
FRA.council.1.d:0 "To truely help keep Europe safe it has become clear to France that the Entente Council must become a military alliance capable of directly supporting all of it's members. Paris sees our participation in this alliance as key to it's success but while the guarantee of protection is a warm welcome the responsibilities that come with it are not as popular but the threat of Germany and the Soviets may force us to strongly consider France's invitation."
FRA.council.1.a:0 "[Root.GetName] shall join"
FRA.council.1.b:0 "[Root.GetName] does not need [FROM.GetName]'s help"
FRA.council.2.t:0 "Dissolution of the Entente Council"
FRA.council.2.d:0 "The Entente Council's repeated failures to keep Europe stable have ruined the organization's reputation beyond repair. Members no longer pay their dues and have no faith in France's ability to protect them. Without some major changes the future of Europe is beginning to look bleak."
FRA.council.2.a:0 "Mon Dieu..."
FRA.council.3.t:0 "Dissolution of the Entente Council"
FRA.council.3.d:0 "The Entente Council's repeated failures to keep Europe stable have ruined the organization's reputation beyond repair.

FRA.council.3.a:0 "My God..."
FRA.council.4.t:0 "France and The Entente Council declare war on [Root.GetName]"
FRA.council.4.d:0 "The Cowards in Paris have spread propaganda to the nations of Europe convincing them that we are a threat to European security, a humorous accusation coming from the French of all people. In any case we find our selves in the first major European war since the Great War nearly 20 years ago. What we do next will define the world for decades to come. Against all odds we will beat the French and earn our place as the sole super power or Europe."
FRA.council.4.a:0 "To total victory!"
FRA.council.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] requests material support"
FRA.council.5.d:0 "[From.GetName] has requested, in accordance to Entente Council policy, military materials to help defend their nation in their current conflict. While we are obligated to provide support for nations in need the recent global economic down turn that has already limited our ability to support ourselves let alone another nation."

FRA.council.8.a:0 "The French are backstabbers"
FRA.council.9.t:0 "Germany pushes an aggressive foreign policy"
FRA.council.9.d:0 "Berlin has announced today their intention to reclaim 'lost German lands stolen by France and the Versailles treaty'. Despite our best efforts to contain German expansionism our threats towards Germany ring hollow. It's only a matter of time until Germany drags Europe into another grand conflict."
FRA.council.9.a:0 "We must prepare §R(Entente Member's Confidence drops by 10%)§!"
FRA.council.10.t:0 "Germany publishes propaganda against the Entente"
FRA.council.10.d:0 "In an attempt to undermine us and the Entente Council, Germany has published a pamphlet claiming of mass abuses of power in our colonies and the Rhineland. Children being separated by their mothers at gun point and French forces burning entire villages to the ground are some of the least insulting claims made by the Germans. These accusations are highly exaggerated but some nations seem very convinced despite this."
FRA.council.10.a:0 "This is truly embarrassing. §R(Entente Member's Confidence drops by 10%)§!"
FRA.council.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] requests funding for fortifications"

FRA.council.12.b:0 "We're better on our own"
FRA.council.13.t:0 "France invites us to the Entente military exercise"
FRA.council.13.d:0 "The defense of Europe requires all members of the Entente Council to maintain a well trained and modern army.

FRA.council.13.a:0 "We shall participate"
FRA.council.13.b:0 "We're better on our own"
