 CRO_WHISPERS_OF_ANTIQUITY_DESC:0 "In 1917, Croatia-Slavonia's Ban Iván Skerlecz proclaimed independence, seized Dalmatia and formed a provisional government to carry the nation through the transition from monarchy to republicanism. His rule was however lacking popular support, and so he resigned and the country held free elections in 1918. The country was however under heavy German influence. A succession of unpopular governments ruled the country, making the population lose faith in the two mainstream parties. It's 1936, and elections approach. Will the Republic survive, or collapse under the weight of its own mistakes?"

After the Croatian independence of 1917, Jakša Račić decided to recreate the movement, to represent the most radical pan-South-Slavists. Since Fassa's takeover in Italy, the Movement has been increasingly leaning towards pro-Roman policies. However, many inside the movement disagree, notably the prominent member and activist Niko Bartulović."
 
 #Leaders
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_COPIC_DESC:0 "Vladimir \"Senjko\" Ćopić  is one of the historical leaders of the Communist Party of Croatia, a fervent Utopianist. Before that, he was active in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia, together with most current leftist leaders. Since the party was banned in 1921, he has continued underground, trying to gather as much support as possible for his cause, without much success. In the Croatian Civil War, he was the leader of the party, as he had the most military experience. He leads the Utopianist wing of the Communist Party. While all in the party agree that freeing the people of Croatia is not enough, there are disagreements on the means to achieve this. Senjko seeks to unite the workers of all South Slavic countries under a single Yugoslav identity."
 POLITICS_JOSIP_BROZ_DESC:0 "Josip Broz \"Tito\" has been the leader of the federalist wing of the Communist Party of Croatia. Before that, he was active in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia, together with most currentleftist leaders.Before that, he was active in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia, together with most current leftist leaders. Since the Communist Party was banned in 1921, he has been rallying his followers to support Božidar Adžija's run in the election, hoping to be able to lift the ban. While all in the party agree that freeing the people of Croatia is not enough, there are disagreements on the means to achieve this. He aims to create a federation of workers between South Slavs, freeing them from their oppressors with force if necessary, but avoiding becoming the new ones."
 POLITICS_ANTUN_MAVRAK_DESC:0 "Young but moderate, Antun Mavrak has been a dominating figure in the Communist Party since he joined it in 1924. Leading the most autonomist wing of the party, he has been by many taken as a symbol that communists weren't all dangerous terrorists. That wasn't enough, and communism was banned in 1921 despite everything. Since then, Mavrak has been rallying his supporters, organizing a complete boycott of elections until the ban was lifted. Now, he has been chosen to lead Croatia. While all in the party agree that freeing the people of Croatia is not enough, there are disagreements on the means to achieve this. Mavrak, inspired by the ideas of the greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, aims to create a federation of workers from all the Balkans, to be strong together against all oppressors. To achieve this, he seeks to influence other countries towards socialism without using the force of arms, but rather diplomatic pressure and funds to the local parties: local revolution rather than foreign imposed one."
 POLITICS_BOZIDAR_ADZIJA_DESC:0 "Božidar Adžija is the founder and leader of the Social Democratic party of Croatia. Adžija is by many considered the logical choice to lead the country after the failures of liberals and conservatives. Under Austria-Hungary, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party, and since then, his views haven't changed. He built up his voter base between the poor in rural areas, communist sympathizers and deluded voters of various ideologies."
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_MACEK_DESC:0 "Vladimir \"Vladko\" Maček was one of the most prominent members of the Peasant Party, Stjepan Radić's designated successor. He has been running in elections as the candidate since 1924, as Radić's health conditions worsened. He has led the country since 1930's elections, but his popularity has hit rock bottom since in 1935 his \"protector\" Stjepan Radić died."

 POLITICS_ANTE_PAVELIC_DESC:0 "Ante Pavelić was born in Bosnia-Herzegovina, at time part of the Habsburg Empire, but moved to Croatia as soon as he was old enough to decide. Here, he has organized a far-right organization, the Ustaše, promising to unite all Croats and free them from foreign oppression. His movement has been gaining popularity especially since the failures of the last Maček government, and many see him as a real threat to democracy."
 POLITICS_JAKSA_RACIC_DESC:0 "Jakša Račić has been a real trouble for the Republic. Since the Croatian independence of 1917, he has been agitating the masses to unite Croatia with the other South Slavic countries, creating his own \"Illyrian Movement\". Fascinated with Fassa's ideas, he became more and more radical, eventually becoming convinced of the necessity for all Illyrians to unite under the protection of the Roman Empire."
 POLITICS_PETAR_GRGEC_DESC:0 "Petar Grgec has been a key figure in the politics of Crotia since the beginning of the Republic. His Popular Party saught to represent the interests of the conservative, deeply religious masses of the rural areas. As leader of \"the party of Catholics\", he has been guaranteed a place in the government for many years. However, the one term the Popular Party had was a failure, and many have been drifting away from Grgec, moving towards more radical organizations."

The Bulgarians and the Serbs repeatedly defeated the Byzantine Empire and often got close to destroying it.

 croatia.1.t:0 "The Status of Croatia"
 croatia.1.d:0 "Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1917, Croatia's last ban, Iván Skerlecz, proclaimed the country's independence and formed a provisional government to organize the transition to republicanism. He sent some militias to the borders to seize as much of Croatia as they could. After a series of border skirmishes with Serbia and Italy, Croatia managed to seize Syrmia, Dalmatia and Rijeka. Despite these successes, many of the population saw Skerlecz as a leader imposed on them by the Hungarians, and did not support his rule. He eventually resigned in 1918 and held free elections. Most of the votes went to Stjepan Radić's Peasant Party and to the church-backed Popular Party, creating an unformal two-party system. Radić won and carried through a series of popular reforms. However, under German pressure, he banned communist organizations and parties. Accusing him of being a German puppet, the conservative Popular Party won the 1924 elections, putting their candidate Petar Grgec in charge. During his term, massive parliamentary opposition from other political formations blocked every attempt of reform, making Grgec lose much of his already dubious support. Radić's sudden death in 1935 saw the rise to leader of the party of Vladimir Maček, not even remotely as popular as Radić. The frustrated population started turning to secondary, previously unimportant parties and political associations. Notably, Jakša Račić's Illyrian movement, aligned to Italy, Ante Pavelić's Ustaša, advocating violent removal of all foreign influence from the country, and most importantly the more moderate Socialdemocratic Party of Croatia, led by Božidar Adžija. To add to all this, monarchist nostalgia is widespread throughout the country, being the biggest threat to the Republic in this tense climate. The already backwards economy suffered a heavy blow from 1929's Great Depression, illiteracy is rampant and the relations with Bosnia are tense after Germany's veto on the proposed union with Croatia. What will be the outcome of these elections?"
