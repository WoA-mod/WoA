 #Leaders
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_COPIC_DESC:0 "Vladimir \"Senjko\" Ćopić  is one of the historical leaders of the Communist Party of Croatia, a fervent Utopianist. Before that, he was active in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia, together with most current leftist leaders. Since the party was banned in 1921, he has continued underground, trying to gather as much support as possible for his cause, without much success. In the Croatian Civil War, he was the leader of the party, as he had the most military experience. He leads the Utopianist wing of the Communist Party. While all in the party agree that freeing the people of Croatia is not enough, there are disagreements on the means to achieve this. Senjko seeks to unite the workers of all South Slavic countries under a single Yugoslav identity."
 POLITICS_JOSIP_BROZ_DESC:0 "Josip Broz \"Tito\" has been the leader of the federalist wing of the Communist Party of Croatia. Before that, he was active in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia, together with most currentleftist leaders.Before that, he was active in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia, together with most current leftist leaders. Since the Communist Party was banned in 1921, he has been rallying his followers to support Božidar Adžija's run in the election, hoping to be able to lift the ban. While all in the party agree that freeing the people of Croatia is not enough, there are disagreements on the means to achieve this. He aims to create a federation of workers between South Slavs, freeing them from their oppressors with force if necessary, but avoiding becoming the new ones."
 POLITICS_ANTUN_MAVRAK_DESC:0 "Young but moderate, Antun Mavrak has been a dominating figure in the Communist Party since he joined it in 1924. Leading the most autonomist wing of the party, he has been by many taken as a symbol that communists weren't all dangerous terrorists. That wasn't enough, and communism was banned in 1921 despite everything. Since then, Mavrak has been rallying his supporters, organizing a complete boycott of elections until the ban was lifted. Now, he has been chosen to lead Croatia. While all in the party agree that freeing the people of Croatia is not enough, there are disagreements on the means to achieve this. Mavrak, inspired by the ideas of the greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, aims to create a federation of workers from all the Balkans, to be strong together against all oppressors. To achieve this, he seeks to influence other countries towards socialism without using the force of arms, but rather diplomatic pressure and funds to the local parties: local revolution rather than foreign imposed one."
 POLITICS_BOZIDAR_ADZIJA_DESC:0 "Božidar Adžija is the founder and leader of the Social Democratic party of Croatia. Adžija is by many considered the logical choice to lead the country after the failures of liberals and conservatives. Under Austria-Hungary, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party, and since then, his views haven't changed. He built up his voter base between the poor in rural areas, communist sympathizers and deluded voters of various ideologies."
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_MACEK_DESC:0 "Vladimir \"Vladko\" Maček was one of the most prominent members of the Peasant Party, Stjepan Radić's designated successor. He has been running in elections as the candidate since 1924, as Radić's health conditions worsened. He has led the country since 1930's elections, but his popularity has hit rock bottom since in 1935 his \"protector\" Stjepan Radić died."
 POLITICS_SLAVKO_KVATERNIK_DESC:0 "Slavko Kvaternik is one of the most influential generals of the nation. After the king had fled to Austria, he was chosen to lead the junta to carry the nation back into the republican system."
 POLITICS_CROATIAN_REGENCY_DESC:0 "We have seized power, and now we must choose a king."
 POLITICS_ANTE_PAVELIC_DESC:0 "Ante Pavelić was born in Bosnia-Herzegovina, at time part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but moved to Croatia as soon as he was old enough to decide. Here, he has organized a far-right organization, the Ustaše, promising to unite all Croats and free them from foreign oppression. His movement has been gaining popularity especially since the failures of the last Maček government, and many see him as a real threat to democracy."
 POLITICS_JAKSA_RACIC_DESC:0 "Jakša Račić has been a real trouble for the Republic. During his studies in Prague he became fascinated with the \"Illyrian movement\", who had been the main cause of the rise of Croatian nationalism under Austria-Hungary. After the independence of Croatia, he traveled back to his country to resurrect this movement, under a new, more violent and more nationalistic lead. Since Marco Brescil's rise to power, Račić has been one of his most firm supporters outside Italy, believing in the need for all Illyrians to unite under their ancient ally Rome. This, however, wasn't liked by many members of his own movement, notably Niko Bartulović, who instead interpreted the word "Illyrian" as a mere name to rally together Slavic identites."
 POLITICS_PETAR_GRGEC_DESC:0 "Petar Grgec has been a key figure in the politics of Crotia since the beginning of the Republic. His Popular Party saught to represent the interests of the conservative, deeply religious masses of the rural areas. As leader of \"the party of Catholics\", he has been guaranteed a place in the government for many years. However, the one term the Popular Party had was a failure, and many have been drifting away from Grgec, moving towards more radical organizations."

 CRO_settle_bosnian_question_desc:0 "While Sarkotić has expressed the will to unite all of Bosnia with Croatia, many of his people won't like that, and a full annexation could anger our powerful neighbors. We should seek to broker a deal with the Serbs in order to effectively partition the land."

 CRO_lift_ban_communism_desc:0 "In the very first years of independence, Stjepan Radić gave in to German pressure and banned all parties that associated with communism. Such a ban is antidemocratic, and we should immediately lift it. This move will not only appease the communists in our country, but also improve our relations with Danubia and simultaneously weaken the Peasant Party, who banned communism in the first place."
 CRO_ties_to_danubia:0 "Ties to Danubia"
 CRO_ties_to_danubia_desc:0 "Danubia is our most powerful neighbor, and they might still have territorial ambitions in our country. To ensure peace, we must improve relations with them. We could even ask them to protect our country from foreign invasions."

 CRO_commie_threat:0 "The Red Menace"

 cr_croatia.1.d:0 "This year's elections will happen in a particularly tense climate. The traditional conservative and liberal dualism no longer satisfies the electorate, with many turning to the Social Democrats as their alternative or even to illegal associations. The Ustaše have been gaining consensus, but the real threat to our republic are the monarchist, who now have more support than the mainstream parties. Many fear a coup d'etat. Most doubt someone would intervene against it."
