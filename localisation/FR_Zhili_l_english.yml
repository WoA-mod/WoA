### DESCRIPTION ###
ZHI_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "The Zhili Clique is one of China’s finest warlord states and is led by, perhaps the greatest strategist in China at this time, Wu Peifu. Wu Peifu is a Chinese nationalist who, although he doesn't like his alliance with the Japanese, sees the alliance with Japan as a necessity for the survival of his Clique. It has, like many other states in China, been in many wars and has a veteran force of many soldiers and generals, but lacks good industry.\n\nFengtian, rival of the Zhili Clique, lies to the north, taunting them at every step. A war is brewing... And the Zhili Clique will be its victor."

### EVENTS ###
zhi.1.t:0 "Far to the East part 1"
zhi.1.d:0 "The Zhili Clique,\nonce we were the greatest Warlord state China had yet seen, now but a rump state seemingly on its last legs. The formation of the Zhili clique was one of discrimination towards officers of the former Beiyang Government, which has led to our clique, in particular,  having very loose ties between its members.\n\nOur journey towards greatness started with the leadership of Feng Guozhang.\n\nIn 1917, when the Zhang Xun’s Restorationist forces marched on Beijing to restore the Qing dynasty to the throne, Feng Guozhang, who at this time was Acting Vice-President of the republic, was sworn in as Acting President.\n Following this, the Anhui Clique (led by Duan Qirui) and the Zhili Clique emerged as the dominant forces in China.\n\nFeng’s term ran out in late 1918, and he would go on to die in 1919. The new leader of the Clique would now be Cao Kun.\n\nPatience with Duan was running out and Wu Peifu and Cao Kun started assembling a military alliance to oppose the Anhui Clique, including Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian Clique.\nThis led to Duan dismissing both Wu Peifu and Cao Kun, even though this was not within his power. He now mobilised his army, now the “National Pacification Army”, and moved to attack the Zhili Clique. This is the beginning of the Zhili-Anhui war.\n\nThe Zhili-Anhui war was where our great leader “Wu Peifu” showed his military prowess, and where it became clear how poorly led the Anhui Clique was, as it was defeated in the span of 12 days with all of its forces either surrendering, deserting or simply being killed. The war resulted in an uneasy coalition between the Zhili and Fengtian cliques.\n\nShortly after the current president is replaced with Liang Shiyi without prior consultation with the Zhili Clique, causing a further divide between the two. Not long after they also reshuffle the cabinet, now with members that are more favourable towards Zhang Zuolin. The Zhili Clique disapproves of this but are overruled. The final straw, however, is when the Clique is denied its 3 million dollar military budget which had previously been agreed to.\nWu Peifu and other members of the clique force Liang Shiyi to step down after this.\n\nThis causes Zhang Zuolin to threaten the Zhili with force, leading to the First Zhili-Fengtian war. Another great victory for the Zhili, with the march north only ending when the Japanese decide to step in and broker a peace. The Fengtian plan their revenge intensively for the years to come."
zhi.1.a:0 "Part 2"
zhi.101.t:0 "Far to the East part 2"
zhi.101.d:0 "The 2nd Zhili-Fengtian war leaves an unstable triumvirate of Feng (Guominjun), Duan (Anhui), and Zhang (Fengtian).\n\nThe Fengtian clique eventually started to ask for help from their former enemy, Wu Peifu. They entered into an alliance as Wu Peifu was still greatly angered by the betrayal of Feng’s Guominjun.\n\nAfter a division commander from the Fengtian Clique defects to the Guominjun and lays siege to Mukden the Anti-Fengtian war begins. The siege was lifted by the Japanese Kwantung army and Guo (the division commander) was killed. The Guominjun starts to lose soldiers fast and in large number, to both deserting and battle.As the KMT enter the war, the Guominjun push into the Zhili Clique from the west. The KMT make great progress until their attention is split because of a rebellion in Guangdong. In the north Wu Peifu’s forces enter Beijing and turn on their allies of the Fengtian Clique, starting the Third Zhili-Fengtian war. Due to the Zhili’s war with the KMT, the Japan decide to leave the Fengtian to defend themselves and support the Zhili. However, a cease-fire is quickly announced between the two factions as the Zhili are surrounded on all sides by the Guominjun, the KMT and the warlord Zhang Zongchang with the Fengtian being wary of the Zhili’s Japanese support.\n\nThe Zhili, slowly being pushed north, drive the KMT to standstill. Zhang of Fengtian Clique now declares himself the Chinese Republic with his rule of Beijing. Neither the Zhili or the KMT are happy about this, but can’t do much about it. The war between the two officially ends with the Zhili being a shadow of its former self, with some citing it as a great achievement that they could even withstand the KMT’s might.\n\nThe Zhili recover of the next few years and eventually declare a Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war, quickly recovering Shandong and setting up defensive positions. This war is a huge success for the Zhili who eventually wins with Japanese backing.\n\nAfter the success of the Zhili Clique, Japan starts to develop its ties with them trying to add more pawns to the region. The Zhili Clique are now considered an outstanding force in China, because they had withstood the might of both the Fengtian and the Anhui without foreign backing.\n\nCao Kun acquires the Presidency by bribing the assembly with 5.000 silver dollars each. This only ends up damaging the already shaky foundations of the republic. As one of his first acts he tries to pull through the most progressive and democratic constitutions yet. It is ignored completely.\n\nThe Fengtian Clique, now allied with the KMT and the Zhili general “Feng Yuxiang” after bribing him, Zhang Zuolin leads his troops to the Manchurian border. This is the beginning of the Second Zhili-Fengtian war.\n\nZhang Zuolin’s assaults on Wu Peifu’s army were beaten back several times because of the Zhili’s entrenched and geographically advantageous position. Then, on the 23rd of October, Feng made his move and launched the Beijing Coup which led to Cao Kun’s house arrest and, eventually, Wu Peifu being forced to flee to Central China."
zhi.101.a:0 "Not one inch of land to our foes!"
zhi.2.t:0 "The Military Committee"
zhi.2.d:0 "In a few days our military committee will be deciding on a plan for our futures offensives. The outcome, only time can tell but many agree that it would be disastrous should we fail to make a decision at such a crucial point in the Clique's history."
zhi.2.a:0 "A decision must be taken"
zhi.3.t:0 "The Committee begins"
zhi.3.d:0 "All of our officers have gathered in our military headquarters to finally decide on a doctrine of warfare, that is to be used in the coming war against the Fengtian Clique.\nTwo plans have been proposed, one by Sun Chuanfang, Wu Peifu's protege and trusted general and one by Wu Peifu.\n\nSun Chuanfang's plan suggests that if we manage to get superior weapons with more destructive capability than that of the Fengtian Clique, they wouldn't stand a chance against our army. Wu Peifu, however, thinks our weapons secondary to the leadership of our troops, and believes we should focus on enforcing a stricter authority within our army, especially with the betrayal of Feng Yuxiang still within living memory.\n\nThe Committee seems to be more in favour of the plan which doesn't involve giving away more of their own power, and..."
zhi.3.a:0 "Choose Sun Chuanfang's plan with no interference"
zhi.3.b:0 "Choose Sun Chuanfang's plan but are overruled by Wu Peifu!"
zhi.3.c:0 "Get into a fight with each other without coming to a decision..."
zhi.4.t:0 "Organise the Militias"
zhi.4.d:0 "Across the countryside, within our mighty state, there are... Bands of militias not strictly under our direct control who, although they seek the best for the Zhili clique, are unpredictable and not easily controlled. If we expect to have a sufficiently organised and ready army for when the inevitable war with the Fengtian Clique comes, we must deal with this soon. A few options have been suggested to deal with the problem at hand."
zhi.4.a:0 "Integrate the soldiers, execute the officers"
zhi.4.b:0 "Imprison the leaders and disperse the militias, they are no use to us"
zhi.4.c:0 "The officers could prove useful, disperse the militias"
zhi.5.t:0 "Japanese Training Methods"
zhi.5.d:0 "By putting the knowledge of our Japanese allies to use, we've managed to greatly improve descipline within our army. This should be most useful in our future wars."
zhi.5.a:0 "Through discipline comes freedom."
zhi.6.t:0 "Remind them why we fight"
zhi.6.d:0 ""We are surrounded by enemies on all sides, by foreign imperialists, traitors of the Beiyang Government, former brothers in arms now turned against us. All we have, my countrymen and people of the Zhili state, is ourselves and the comradery between us. Let that go and what are we left with? Happiness? No. Fear. Fear and despair. Without your brothers in arms, the fight for freedom would be without hope and all would be lost. The Zhili Clique exists, not as a reminder of what the Beiyang Government should have been, but what the people of China can be! We are not a group of unorganised rascals, far from it. We're the Zhili Clique, masters of all doctrines of war and instruments of battle! So, if you have nothing to fight for. Fight for your brothers. FIGHT FOR CHINA!"\n\nSo went the speech of Wu Peifu this morning outside the Zhili headquarters in Hefei. His men were quick to cheer, even if the words were not of the most profound kind."
zhi.6.a:0 "The grim bitterness of the coming war has been brightened, if only slightly."
zhi.7.t:0 "A Zhili Flagship"
zhi.7.d:0 "It is no secret that our current fleet is a sorry one. We need a large capital ship to spearhead our fleet and bring fear to our enemies. Construction will be done as soon as next year."
zhi.7.a:0 "A year!?"
zhi.8.t:0 "The Maiden Voyage of the 'Yù Huáng'"
zhi.8.d:0 "After a year of preparations our new Flagship is finally ready to be used! The 'Yù Huáng', named after the Jade Emperor of Chinese myth, is 145 meters long and carries 8 smaller 50 calliber guns along with its heavier 3-pounder cannons."
zhi.8.a:0 "Surely this will strike fear into our foes!"
zhi.9.t:0 "The Fifth Zhili-Fengtian War"
zhi.9.d:0 "The Great Rivalry which exists between the Zhili Clique and the Fengtian Clique to the north has finally come to a head. With Fengtian movements along the border turning into full blown assaults on our forward positions, now there is only one way to end this once and for all.\n\nThe end of the Fengtian Clique is at hand."
zhi.9.a:0 "Glory to the Zhili Clique!"
zhi.9.b:0 "B-but we're not ready!"
zhi.200.d:0 "The damned Zhili clique has coerced former bandits within our glorious realm to return to their former occupation. Our supply lines are suffering greatly and it will take some time before we can hunt them down."
zhi.200.a:0 "Traitors! Every single one!"
zhi.201.t:0 "The Zhili Clique requests assistance"
zhi.201.d:0 "With the agreement made with Zhili Clique before the start of the Fifth Zhili-Fengtian war, they now expect us to send them help in form of supplies.\nDoing so would surely bolster our influence in the Clique and draw them closer to our sphere, however, it would also antigonise the Japanese. We should ask ourselves, do we really want to be involved in another war in China?"
zhi.201.a:0 "We must honour our agreement, send them guns!"
zhi.201.b:0 "Absolutely, we must increase our influence in China. Send them guns and volunteers!"
zhi.201.c:0 "Making an enemy of the Japanese is the last thing we want."
zhi.202.t:0 "The British have sent us guns!"
zhi.202.d:0 "The British have shown their support by supplying us with some much needed guns."
zhi.202.a:0 "Today, we stand with the foreign Imperialist."
zhi.203.t:0 "The British have sent us both volunteers and guns!"
zhi.203.d:0 "The British have shown their support by supplying us with some much needed guns and manpower."
zhi.203.a:0 "Today, we stand with the foreign Imperialist."
zhi.204.t:0 "The British have rejected our request!"
zhi.204.d:0 "It seems the only true ally the Clique can rely on is itself. This morning, a British envoy arrived and informed us that we would not be sent guns or supplies of any measure."
zhi.204.a:0 "We stand by ourselves... As always"
zhi.205.t:0 "The Zhili Clique request British volunteer officers"
zhi.205.d:0 "We've received a message from the Jade Marshal himself, that the Zhili Clique is in need of foreign officers to instruct new troops being prepared for the frontline. Will we help our new "friend"?"
zhi.205.a:0 "Why, of course! Send whoever is available."
zhi.205.b:0 "That would only be a waste of time."
zhi.206.t:0 "The British have supplied us with spare officers!"
zhi.206.d:0 "With these we can finally prepare our new troops for the field properly."
zhi.206.a:0 "We might finally have a real army..."
zhi.207.t:0 "The British have turned away our request!"
zhi.207.d:0 "Our request was rejected with only four words on the message that was sent back "Waste of our time"."
zhi.207.a:0 "We'll teach them respect soon enough."
zhi.208.t:0 "A blockade of the Yellow Sea?"
zhi.208.d:0 "The Zhili Clique's leader and marshal, Wu peifu, has proposed that we blockade the Yellow Sea to stop the transportation of all vital supplies from outside sources to Fengtian. While this sounds like a great idea on paper, we may have trouble with Fengtian should they win the war.\n\nShould we go ahead?"
zhi.208.a:0 "Prepare the fleet, we have faith in the Jade Marshal."
zhi.208.b:0 "Inform them that we cannot do this for ethical reasons."
zhi.10.t:0 "The Great Rivalry is Over"
zhi.10.d:0 "After many years of constant wars, we've finally bested the Fengtian Clique. Many of our own have died for the our cause, the cause of China."
zhi.10.a:0 "It's Finally Over"
zhi.11.t:0 "An Unnerving Silence Fills the Air"
zhi.11.d:0 "Ever since we defeated our greatest foe, peace and regular military parades have been held throughout the newly reclaimed capital of Beijing. However, in recent days there's been an unusually unnerving feeling within the walls of capital buildings of the Beiyang Government. Maybe it's just rumours, but some have reported sightings of mass gatherings within secluded buildings, strange crates arriving from non-existant provinces, and weirdest of all, a new flag spreading throughout the city..."
zhi.11.a:0 "Assure the staff that these are nothing but rumours"
zhi.11.b:0 "Bribe, murder, and interrogate. Something is very wrong."
zhi.12.t:0 "Sun Chuanfang's Coup"
zhi.12.d:0 "The rumours have proven to be true. Just this morning, Sun Chuanfang moved his private army of mercenaries and veterans of the League of Five Provinces from hidden safehouses, quickly capturing strategic buildings and arms depots within the city. Before long the entire capital was on complete lockdown with Wu Peifu surrounded by troops personally led by Sun, he chose to fight the traitor rather than be cast aside."
zhi.12.a:0 "Wu Peifu dies in the following battle..." # :(
zhi.12.b:0 "...But he takes Sun Chuanfang with him" #Yay?
zhi.13.t:0 "Sun Chuanfang's Arrest"
zhi.13.d:0 "Through violent force we've finally arrested the vast majority of the culprits within the city. It seems they were all either former members of the League of Five Provinces or mercenaries paid directly from Sun Chuanfang's earnings. At 4 AM this morning our troops were told to surround Sun Chuanfang's house and arrest him. However, it seems he was alerted of our approach beforehand and managed to gather his forces for a final show of resistance.\n\nAfter a brief struggle, Sun is arrested and his men are executed."
zhi.13.a:0 "Of all people, you, I would never have expected to betray me" #Heart = broken
zhi.14.t:0 "The Trial of Sun Chuanfang"
zhi.14.d:0 "The bell rings three times before court is in session. Sun Chuanfang, the former leader of the League of Five Provinces and trusted protege of Wu Peifu has been found guilty of treason. Not long after he is taken to gallows to be hanged, though not along with lowlife criminals as is usually the case, no. The hills have been cleared for this horrid occasion as Wu Peifu had asked. Five long minutes pass and it's over. He's dead. The toll this will take on the army, and the nation as a whole, is yet to be seen, though he will surely be missed."
zhi.14.a:0 "He served his country well and will forever be remembered as a hero of China" #Heart = double broken
zhi.15.t:0 "Our Claim to the Beiyang Government"
zhi.15.d:0 "Not too many years ago, we were the undisputed rulers of China. It's time to bring back our golden age and launch China into an age of prosperity and might. Forever the Beiyang Government shall be remembered as the true rulers of the Chinese nation!"
zhi.15.a:0 "The rightful ruler of China is ME!"
zhi.16.t:0 "Our Claim to the Beiyang Government"
zhi.16.d:0 "Not too many years ago, we were the undisputed rulers of China. It's time to bring back our golden age and launch China into an age of prosperity and might. Forever the Beiyang Government shall be remembered as the true rulers of the Chinese nation!"
zhi.16.a:0 "The rightful rulers of China have returned"
zhi.17.t:0 "Our Claim to the Beiyang Government"
zhi.17.d:0 "Not too many years ago, we were the undisputed rulers of China. It's time to bring back our golden age and launch China into an age of prosperity and might. Forever the Beiyang Government shall be remembered as the true rulers of the Chinese nation!"
zhi.17.a:0 "The rightful rulers of China have returned"
zhi.18.t:0 "The Election"
zhi.18.d:0 "The voting was swift, with large crowds forming around the designated voting-halls knowing exactly who to vote for. The opposion of Cao Kun stood no chance, he was, after all, the person who instituted the elections in the first place. The future only knows what democracy will bring to China in the future."
zhi.18.a:0 "Huh, winning elections is easy... With a little help"
zhi.19.t:0 "Movement for an Elected Regional Administration"
zhi.19.d:0 "Some of the newest additions to our glorious administration though welcome, are not elected. Many people within our nation dislike this and believe we should have elected regional administrators... Is this a good idea?"
zhi.19.a:0 "The law is passed and the elections will proceed right away"
zhi.19.b:0 "This might cause trouble with the administrators in question..."
zhi.20.t:0 "The New Constitution"
zhi.20.d:0 "Now that we have utter control of the republic's administration we need to decide on the constitution. The people are, of course, crying for democracy as they have done for so many years. Should we give in to these cries for so-called freedom?"
zhi.20.a:0 "Give the people what they want!"
zhi.20.b:0 "Give the people what they want, but with slight ensurances"
zhi.20.c:0 "A Presidential Dictatorship will be fine"
zhi.21.t:0 "A Return to Our Former Glory"
zhi.21.d:0 "China is splintered. Torn between military cliques in every direction. Some may be able to be negotiated with, others not so much. Only time will tell who will join our glorious nation in a united nation and who we will have to throw off along the wayside. Progress stops for no one."
zhi.21.a:0 "We shall make China a great nation once again"
zhi.22.t:0 "The Chinese Demand our Subjugation"
zhi.22.d:0 "The new Chinese government in Beijing is demanding that we lay down our arms and join them in what looks to be a very cruel and one-sided treaty very unlike the one we were given in previous years. Should be accept this we would not only be ceding one of the only parts of Inner Mongolia we managed to occupy during the discord of our revolution, but the very freedom of our people. It would, however, spare our nation from another terrible war with China."
zhi.22.a:0 "If this will spare our citizens..."
zhi.22.b:0 "We will never surrender to foreign invaders!"
zhi.23.t:0 "The Mongols have replied that they'd "rather die than surrender""
zhi.23.d:0 "In a rather direct letter the Mongols have replied sternly that the agreement we gave them is outrageous and have mobilised against us. They ready for war."
zhi.23.a:0 "And we shall give it to them"
zhi.24.t:0 "The Mongols Kneel"
zhi.24.d:0 "The Mongol leadership has decided that to spare the citizens of their nation they will agree to our treaty."
zhi.24.a:0 "They know what is best for them"
zhi.25.t:0 "An Offer from the Beiyang Government"
zhi.25.d:0 "The Beiyang Government has sent us a proposal which suggests a pact of mutual non-aggression. This would free up a front and give us more time to focus on the larger threat; the Soviets, and might even open up for future Chinese support."
zhi.25.a:0 "A wonderful idea!"
zhi.25.b:0 "We have enough support"
zhi.26.t:0 "The Russian have Agreed"
zhi.26.d:0 "The Russians have responded that they would gladly agree to such a suggestion."
zhi.26.a:0 "Another front freed up"
zhi.27.t:0 "The Russians have declined"
zhi.27.d:0 "The Russians believe that they have enough support and have as such declined our offer."
zhi.27.a:0 "We'll have to watch them closely then"
zhi.28.t:0 "The Beiyang Government Offers Integration"
zhi.28.d:0 "The Beiyang Government has offered us a rather intriguing offer. They suggest that we join their nation as part of a greater whole, and in turn retain control over the Yunnan region as a regional administrator."
zhi.28.a:0 "I'll stay in power then?"
zhi.28.b:0 "If they want Yunnan so bad, they can come and take it!"
zhi.29.t:0 "Long Yun has Agreed"
zhi.29.d:0 "Long Yun has decided that a nominal position within the rightful government of China would be preferable to war."
zhi.29.a:0 "Excellent!"
zhi.30.t:0 "Long Yun Resists"
zhi.30.d:0 "The Yunnan Clique resists our demands and prepares for war."
zhi.30.a:0 "Not for long"
zhi.31.t:0 "The Beiyang Government Offers Integration"
zhi.31.d:0 "The Beiyang Government has offered us a rather intriguing offer. They suggest that we join their nation as part of a greater whole, and in turn retain control over the Sichuan region as a regional administrator."
zhi.31.a:0 "As long as I retain control of Sichuan"
zhi.31.b:0 "Ha! As if I'd ever give up control"
zhi.32.t:0 "Deng Xihou has Agreed"
zhi.32.d:0 "Deng Xihou has decided that a nominal position within the rightful government of China would be preferable to war."
zhi.32.a:0 "Good choice"
zhi.33.t:0 "Deng Xihou Resists"
zhi.33.d:0 "The Sichuan Clique resists our demands and prepares for war."
zhi.33.a:0 "He'll come to regret that decision very quickly"
zhi.34.t:0 "The Beiyang Government has provided guns!"
zhi.34.d:0 "The Beiyang Government, has, as part of our previous agreement, sent us guns to help our war effort against the Soviets!"
zhi.34.a:0 "Our friends to south are becoming increasingly helpful"
zhi.35.t:0 "The Beiyang Government Proposes an Anti-Soviet Alliance"
zhi.35.d:0 "The Beiyang Government suggests that we might be able to better defend outselves and take our righful place in Moscow, if we had the help of the Chinese nation. This would undoubtedly give us a huge advantage against our enemies and possibly a future bond that could launch both the Russian and Chinese nations into a golden age of cooperation."
zhi.35.a:0 "With all of China at our side, we can't possibly lose!"
zhi.35.b:0 "We dare not threaten our current backers with such an agreement"
zhi.36.t:0 "The Russians have Agreed!"
zhi.36.d:0 "A new power will rise in the form of the temporarily named "Anti-Soviet Alliance", which will perhaps have to be renamed once the Soviet menace is destroyed. For now, this is a momentous occasion and one that should strike fear into our enemies."
zhi.36.a:0 "The time has come to destroy the Socialist menace!"
zhi.37.t:0 "The Russians have Declined"
zhi.37.d:0 "We've today received the sad news that the Russians do not share our vision of an alliance united against the Soviets."
zhi.37.a:0 "Disappointing"
zhi.38.t:0 "The World Will Fear Our Strength Once More!"
zhi.38.d:0 "Long ago the name "China" once struck fear into the hearts of Kings and Emperors far and wide, now it is but a fraction of what it once was. This will not do. We shall remake the might of China under the rule of Sun Chuanfang, the great Warlord and leader of the new Chinese nation! Hail the Nanking Warlord! Hail Sun!"
zhi.38.a:0 "The Dragon roars!"
zhi.39.t:0 "The Mongolian Resistance"
zhi.39.d:0 "Our occupation of Mongolia has not gone "quite" as expected, with the military general Khatanbaatar escaping our grasp and recruiting what amounts to a small army, raiding supply lines going to and from Mongolia, steadily wearing our forces down, who can say how long we'll be able to hold out?\nThese nomadic barbarians have already thrown off Chinese occupation twice, if we don't act fast we WILL be the third."
zhi.39.a:0 "How many? 2 THOUSAND?! HOW!?"
zhi.40.t:0 "An offer from the Grand Marshal"
zhi.40.d:0 "Intelligentmoire is very smartmoire Gyahahhahalkalmoire... Kalmoire is very good, large THIGHS. Hmphsies. (If you see this, I'm so very sorry) debugger here, wtf am I reading"
zhi.40.a:0 "Ughsies"
zhi.41.d:0 "For years now, the Fengtian Government, our greatest rival, has been sitting right on our border taunting us with every passing day. Now, we are ready. We will give them a war unlike any other. Fire and brimstone, artillery shells hailing from the skies like thunder. The tide is turning... And the Zhili Clique will reap its bounty."
zhi.41.a:0 "It is time to retake our place in China"
zhi.209.d:0 "The Zhili need weapons in the war for Chinese supremacy, and seeing as we've declared our support for them, they've seen fit to request material support."
zhi.209.a:0 "Supplies will be needed in their war"
zhi.209.b:0 "This doesn't sound like a great deal"
zhi.210.d:0 "A large fleet of ships has been positioned in the Yellow Sea, stopping most, if not all, of our convoys."
zhi.210.a:0 "Damn the Japanese!"
zhi.211.d:0 "Our request was granted. With Japanese support, Fengtian stands no chance."
zhi.211.a:0 "Reliable as always"
zhi.212.d:0 "The request we made was denied."
zhi.212.a:0 "Disappointing, but not unexpected"
zhi.213.d:0 "A full shipment of guns have arrived today in Qingdao harbour, quickly being transported to the frontlines."
zhi.213.a:0 "Excellent"
zhi.214.d:0 "Our request for guns from Japan has been denied."
zhi.214.a:0 "A shame, but not completely unexpected"
zhi.250.t:0 "The Chinese Have Demanded We Leave China!"
zhi.250.d:0 "The new Chinese government, The former Zhili clique, has demanded that we immediately leave our colonies in China and in turn hand it over to their "rightful" government."
zhi.250.a:0 "If they want them so badly, they can come and take them!"
zhi.250.b:0 "The Chinese are stronger than ever, to face them would be virtual suicide"
zhi.251.t:0 "The British are resistant!"
zhi.251.d:0 "The British have chosen to stay their ground and don't seem to be giving up their territories anytime soon. If this goes on, we might not even see our colonies' return after the supposed "lease" end."
zhi.251.a:0 "Then we have no choice but to seize the colonies by force"
zhi.251.b:0 "We're not ready for a war with the British"
zhi.252.d:0 "The British have, after much debate, given in to our demands."
zhi.252.a:0 "Excellent news"
zhi.253.d:0 "When faced with the opposition of the British nation, the Chinese chose to flee instead of fight. Maybe this "new China" isn't much different from the old one after all."
zhi.253.a:0 "Pathetic"
zhi.254.d:0 "Beijing, the capital of the former Chinese Republic, now in the hands of its righful masters. Finally, we have a capital worthy of our splendor once again."
zhi.254.a:0 "The masters of China have returned to their rightful place"
zhi.255.d:0 "The new Chinese government, The former Zhili clique, has demanded that we immediately leave our colonies in China and in turn hand it over to their "rightful" government."
zhi.255.a:0 "This matter should be decided in France!"
zhi.255.b:0 "France needn't worry about this matter"
zhi.256.d:0 "Demands have been made that we should turn over our Chinese possessions to the new Beiyang Government. Should we fail to win a possible war with this faction it could mean the end of French rule in East-Asia. Is it worth it?"
zhi.256.a:0 "We will fight to the last man for our glorious empire!"
zhi.256.b:0 "We can't risk losing more of our East-Asian possessions"
zhi.257.d:0 "The French are resisting our demands. The French colonial empire is not something to be taken lightly, however, with their attention tightly locked on the German threat it may be a war we could win."
zhi.257.a:0 "If war is what they want, then war they shall get"
zhi.257.b:0 "This may be more than we can handle"
zhi.258.d:0 "The French have given in to our demands and are as such ceding all territory in China to our righteous government."
zhi.258.a:0 "The imperialists fall one by one"
zhi.259.d:0 "The Chinese government has backed down. We should expect no more hassle from them."
zhi.259.a:0 "Pushovers"
zhi.260.d:0 "The new Chinese government, The former Zhili clique, has demanded that we immediately leave our colonies in China and in turn hand it over to their "rightful" government."
zhi.260.a:0 "We don't really have much of a choice..."
zhi.260.b:0 "We can at least give them a fight!"
zhi.261.d:0 "The Portuguese have given in to our demands and handed over the port city of Macau."
zhi.261.a:0 "Great news!"
zhi.262.d:0 "The Portuguese have refused to give up their colony in China."
zhi.262.a:0 "They asked for this"
zhi.262.b:0 "Maybe we're not ready after all..."
zhi.263.d:0 "The new Chinese government, The former Zhili clique, has demanded that we immediately leave our colonies in China and in turn hand it over to their "rightful" government."
zhi.263.a:0 "No surrender!"
zhi.263.b:0 "Send for the British embassy immediately!"
zhi.263.c:0 "We'll hand it over..."
zhi.275.d:0 "The Fengtian Clique's war seems all but lost, they've been pushed back beyond recovery. Perhaps it's time we intervene and suggest a peace favourable to both us and the Zhili Clique."
zhi.275.a:0 "Manchuria has lost, they have no choice but to submit"
zhi.276.d:0 "The Japanese have sent us a request that we make peace with the Zhili Clique and give up our remaining land in Manchuria to spare the Chinese people from further bloodshed... We, of course, know that this is just a ploy to give them our land. But do we have any choice?"
zhi.276.a:0 "Our forced are too crippled to continue"
zhi.276.b:0 "We fight on... Even if it seems like a doomed effort"
zhi.277.d:0 "The Japanese have brokered a peace that seems to be both in favour of us and them. They believe this to be the end of their toils in China related to us. We know they are sorely mistaken."
zhi.277.a:0 "Don't demobilise a single soldier... We'll need them"
zhi.278.d:0 "The Fengtian Government has agreed to our peace offer and we have taken over rule of the agreed parts of the Manchuria region."
zhi.278.a:0 "As expected"
zhi.279.d:0 "We've recently received word that the requests from the Japanese, for the Fengtian Government to submit, have been rejected. How this will affect future events is yet to be discovered."
zhi.279.a:0 "We fight on!"
zhi.280.d:0 "The Fengtian Government has declined our offer and have chosen to continue their hopeless fight in China."
zhi.280.a:0 "They will see the error in their ways in time"
zhi.281.d:0 "With the British now fully recovered from economic crisis, it may be in our interest to seek their help. They have significant experience with modern warfare and the many new ideas emerging at this time."
zhi.281.a:0 "Why should Japan be our only help in the coming war?"
zhi.281.b:0 "Allying ourselves with more imperialists would be most unwise"
zhi.282.d:0 "With the Zhili-Fengtian situation quickly racing towards a future war, the Zhili Clique has reached out to us for for assurances that we will give them support in the event of a future war. This could potentially give us a strong ally in East Asia that would be invaluable should Japan become a problem."
zhi.282.a:0 "Interests in China must be kept under close protection. A fine idea!"
zhi.282.b:0 "Why do you bother me with such nonsense?!"
zhi.283.d:0 "The British have sent word that they will send support in the event of a war with Fengtian."
zhi.283.a:0 "Invite their envoys to dinner immediately!"
zhi.284.d:0 "The British have responded that they have no interest in supporting us."
zhi.284.a:0 "A shame, but we ready ourselves for war all the same"
zhi.285.d:0 "Just this morning we received word that an incident on the Zhili border near Manchuria occured. 547 dead and only a measly excuse to show for it. Wu Peifu claims the men were acting on their own accord, but our men report differently. Our reports say that these men were acting under tight coordination and not without order or discipline as we've been led to believe."
zhi.285.a:0 "Whatever we do, we should tread carefully"
zhi.285.b:0 "This is reason enough. TO WAR!"
zhi.286.d:0 "Once more, Zhili soldiers have fired upon Japanese squadrons. This time patrols near Qingdao were bombarded with artillery shells from afar, with little to no survivors in units we've heard from so far."
zhi.286.a:0 "Savage bandits. They'll pay in time"
zhi.286.b:0 "Enough is enough!"
zhi.287.d:0 "Just this afternoon, a division or two from the Zhili army crossed over the borders between them and Qingdao again, raiding a military base first and next striking down the response troops who came to stop them. There was nothing they could've done, the precision and timing of the Zhili troops could not have been better. Our people demand war... And we shall happily oblige"
zhi.287.a:0 "This is too much, prepare for a war unlike any other!"
zhi.288.d:0 "The Japanese have taken a liking to being on Chinese soil. This will not do. A plan has been hatched to conduct a series of border raids on Japanese forces and military positions in such a way that no Chinese civilian should be harmed. We hope this will eventually provoke the Japanese enough to go to war, maybe even in a weakened state."
zhi.288.a:0 "Let's show them who owns China"
zhi.289.d:0 "After a savage ordeal on the Manchurian border just yesterday, the Japanese have demanded that we give them an apology for what our men did."
zhi.289.a:0 "Oops?"
zhi.290.d:0 "The Japanese warn us that should we take this any further they will be forced to respond with force."
zhi.290.a:0 "What a weak response"
zhi.291.d:0 "The majority of the Japanese possessions in mainland China have been forced from their hand, and with a land army strong enough to defeat the Japanese three times over we can end this now."
zhi.291.a:0 "Send the demands"
zhi.291.b:0 "No! We must have total victory!"
zhi.292.d:0 "The Zhili marshal, Wu Peifu, has ordered that we lay down arms and give up our territories in mainland China as we have no strength to retake them."
zhi.292.a:0 "We have no choice but to surrender"
zhi.293.d:0 "Artillery shells boom across the fronlines, dead men fill the trenches, bullets and the smell of gunpowder fill the air. Truly, the horrors of war are upon us. Reports of the dead eyes of the men who are forced ever onwards in the name of victory are becoming evermore frequent as the fighting continues. Yet, we have no choice but to continue."
zhi.293.a:0 "Oh, the horror!"
zhi.294.d:0 "Lao She, a renowned writer from Beijing, has just released his newest book "Rickshaw Boy". The book tells the story of a boy named "Xiangzi" who makes a living pulling a rickshaw and story largely revolves around this fact. The book has received very favourable reviews and surprisingly hasn't been banned for its portrayal of the Warlord armies."
zhi.294.a:0 "Absolutely stunning work"
zhi.295.d:0 "A movement has taken root in China. One that seeks to rebuild the very foundations of the Chinese society. The so-called Rural Reconstruction Movement, aims to not only rebuild the declining economy at macro levels, but also improve the lives and productivity of the rural workers. It emphasises the importance of modernisation of not only the factories in China, but also the administrative divisions used to, for example, collect taxes."
zhi.295.a:0 "A commendable goal"
zhi.296.d:0 "The Emperor of the Japanese Empire, Hirohito, visited our proud nation yesterday. The occasion was dinner with Wu Peifu and the discussion of a possible resolution to the Fengtian problem. It seems that they did not come to any conclusive solution in regards to this, but it was a nice evening nonetheless."
zhi.296.a:0 "The Japanese will stay our friends... For now"
zhi.301.d:0 "The newly-declared Beiyang Government of China has requested that they officially join the IPA. They believe that this will strengthen our ties in far east and that perhaps in the future, once they've asserted themselves as the true government in China, we'll be ready to transfer Hong Kong."
zhi.301.a:0 "A great addition to our alliance!"
zhi.301.b:0 "They're not fit for the Imperial Alliance"
zhi.302.d:0 "The British have accepted our proposal, and will stand by our side in any future wars."
zhi.302.a:0 "Great news!"
zhi.303.d:0 "The British have turned away our request. They do not believe we're fit for their alliance."
zhi.303.a:0 "Pompous Imperialists"
zhi.304.d:0 "The Beiyang Government has invited us to join their military faction. They believe that a greater association of Asian nations is needed to counter the aggression of the Japanese. This seems like a noble task indeed, should be accept?"
zhi.304.a:0 "A splendid idea!"
zhi.304.b:0 "We're better off alone"
zhi.305.d:0 "Our invitation has been accepted! East-Asia will soon be free from the shackles of oppression of foreign powers."
zhi.305.a:0 "Excellent"
zhi.306.d:0 "Our invitation has been declined."
zhi.306.a:0 "They lack perspective"
zhi.307.d:0 "The French have lost all their holdings in both China and Indochina. Should we send them the terms of surrender?"
zhi.307.a:0 "They have to accept"
zhi.307.b:0 "No, we press on"
zhi.308.d:0 "The Chinese have completely pushed us out of Asia and are demanding that we surrender now or suffer the consequences."
zhi.308.a:0 "We have no choice"
zhi.308.b:0 "No! We fight till our dying breath!"
zhi.309.d:0 "Our war against imperialism has finally ended in victory."
zhi.309.a:0 "They never stood a chance"
zhi.310.d:0 "Our demands for surrender have been met with resistance. It seems our enemy will not surrender even in this dire situation."
zhi.310.a:0 "If they want to do it the hard way"
zhi.311.d:0 "We've now held both Hong Kong and Weihaiwei for several months without foreign invasions gaining ground in China. Most of our generals agree that this would be an opportune moment to send the British the terms of surrender, that being to cede all their ports in China directly to us."
zhi.311.a:0 "We've waited long enough"
zhi.311.b:0 "No, we need total victory"
zhi.312.d:0 "The Chinese believe that after months of unsuccessful naval invasions, and even less successful defense of our port holdings, it's time we surrender. Though this may be a stain on our honour, it is surely better than being humiliated further."
zhi.312.a:0 "Our manpower is best spent elsewhere"
zhi.312.b:0 "No! We fight till our last dying breath!"
zhi.313.d:0 "The Portuguese have clearly lost this war and would likely accept a conditional surrender. Should send such a demand?"
zhi.313.a:0 "They have to accept"
zhi.313.b:0 "No, we press on"
zhi.314.d:0 "The Chinese have now held Macau for several months without successful intervention and it seems like this trend will continue. As such, they've seen fit to send us a demand for surrender. Should we accept?"
zhi.314.a:0 "If it means an end to the bloodshed..."
zhi.314.b:0 "No. We fight on, Glória à Portugal!"
zhi.315.d:0 "The Portuguese have clearly lost this war and would likely accept a conditional surrender. Should send such a demand?"
zhi.315.a:0 "They have to accept"
zhi.315.b:0 "No, we press on"

###FOCUSES###
ZHI_MAIN_far_east:0 "Far to the East"
ZHI_MAIN_far_east_desc:0 "Beyond the gates to the east, lies a once united kingdom feared by lands wide and far; China, the Middle Kingdom. Since the first president of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai, declared himself the Hongxian Emperor of China leading to the civil war that has plagued China for decades now, the Zhili Clique has been there. Coming close to destruction more than once, we have been molded by the toughest enviroment possible and that is why we shall succeed."
ZHI_MAIN_industry:0 "Our Crumbling Industry"
ZHI_MAIN_industry_desc:0 "To return to our former might it is first and foremost important for our industry to be up to date and working at full efficiency. It is no secret that China as a whole has not only abysmal working enviroments, but also lacks modernisation in both industry and weaponry. We shall try to fix both."
ZHI_MAIN_clear_forests:0 "Clear the Forests"
ZHI_MAIN_clear_forests_desc:0 "To make space for our new factories and future industry, large forrested areas will have to be cleared."
ZHI_MAIN_factories:0 "Establish New Factories"
ZHI_MAIN_factories_desc:0 "To improve our industrial situation it is paramount that we increase the size of our industry substantially. While this seems like a distant goal now, we may soon find ourselves at the foot of an East Asian industrial revolution."
ZHI_MAIN_subsidies:0 "Subsidies for New Companies"
ZHI_MAIN_subsidies_desc:0 "Several people within our nation have goods they want to produce and sell on local as well as international markets. However, the economy within our state is so poor that they don't have the funds to start said companies. A state-sponsored subsidy programme will help fix this problem."
ZHI_MAIN_jap_funds:0 "Ask the Japanese for Funds"
ZHI_MAIN_jap_funds_desc:0 "With the Japanese being our ally, it may be prudent to use this to our advantage. Building new factories will be both expensive and having the funds to do so will be critical. This will, of course, mean that the Japanese have more influence over our future actions and may have grave consequences should tensions arise between our two nations."
ZHI_MAIN_jap_corps:0 "Invite Japanese Corporations"
ZHI_MAIN_jap_corps_desc:0 "Instead of funding companies locally it would benefit us to invite already well-established corporations and companies from Japan. Increasing the amount of general goods in circulation could never possibly hurt our economy."
ZHI_MAIN_jap_imports:0 "Increase Imports from Japan"
ZHI_MAIN_jap_imports_desc:0 "Fears of another famine like the one in 1920s have led to many believing that increasing the, already quite substantial, imports from Japan may be a reasonable idea. The chances of such a famine actually occuring again are uncertain."
ZHI_MAIN_military:0 "Our Mighty Military"
ZHI_MAIN_military_desc:0 "As is clear by the sight of our great and glorious army, the Zhili Clique can be said to be almost anything but anti-military. With one of the largest, most experienced, and well-led armies in China, Zhili stands as a proud reminder of what all of China should strive to be. But, however good the situation may look from the outside, the army is in anything but a good state. Militias made up of bandits freely roam the country whenever they're not serving in the army, the weapons used in the army are outdated, and our troops have a severe lack of discipline and tendency to disobey direct orders. The latter of these issues stems from the fact that our men and armies are made up of loosely bonded men in arms. These issues NEED to be seen to if we are to win in the coming war."
ZHI_MAIN_wu_reforms:0 "Wu Peifu's Reforms"
ZHI_MAIN_wu_reforms_desc:0 "To improve not only the combat effectiveness of our army, but the administrative effectiveness Wu Peifu has come up with a series of reforms that he wishes to push through. The reforms largely mean to restructure the bloated organisation of the armies and to expand the role of the individual squads, as to give them purpose beyond just obeying orders. Whether this will have enough of an effect to matter only time will tell."
ZHI_MAIN_jap_advisors:0 "Japanese Military Advisors"
ZHI_MAIN_jap_advisors_desc:0 "To improve the effectiveness of our armies for the coming war, we should request advisors from the Japanese Imperial Army to be more learnt in the new ways of warfare."
ZHI_MAIN_org_militia:0 "Organise the Militias"
ZHI_MAIN_org_militia_desc:0 "A big portion of our armies derive from common thugs and bandits who enlist when a war breaks out, because the our economy simply can't pay our entire army as it is too large and our nation is too small. We have therefore proposed a number of different solutions to this growing problem."
ZHI_MAIN_why_fight:0 "Remind Them Why We Fight"
ZHI_MAIN_why_fight_desc:0 "Our armies fight for us, but fight for no singular goal except selfishness. Wu Peifu means to ratify this by holding a speech meant to give purpose to both infantryman and officer alike."
ZHI_MAIN_mil_budget:0 "Increase our Military Budget with Japanese Assistance"
ZHI_MAIN_mil_budget_desc:0 "Our military budget may be big, but it can be bigger. It would serve us well if the Japanese could fund our production of new weaponry, uniforms, and the various other supplies needed for a proper army to function."
ZHI_MAIN_jap_weapons:0 "Japanese Weapons"
ZHI_MAIN_jap_weapons_desc:0 "The weapons used in our armies are terribly outdated and ineffective. We should import newer, Japanese models, to compensate for this massive disadvantage. Who knows, maybe we'll learn a thing or two."
ZHI_MAIN_jaden_jewel:0 "The Jaden Jewel of China"
ZHI_MAIN_jaden_jewel_desc:0 "We have improved our provinces and clique as whole, to such a degree that many have started to refer to the Zhili Clique as the "Jaden Jewel" of China, in reference to our leader. The pride can be felt not only in the armies, but also in the streets of our cities. Zhili, has returned to its former glory."
ZHI_MAIN_broken_jewel:0 "The Broken Jewel of China"
