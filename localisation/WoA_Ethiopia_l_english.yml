eth.1.t:0 "The Ethiopian Lion in 1936"
eth.1.d:0 "Ethiopia has fallen far and hard since the end of the Guerra Mondiale. A successful Dervish revolt threw off Abyssinian control of Somali Ethiopia years ago, and Ethiopia's territorial conquests continue to feed the nation with terminal problems nobody seems to know how to solve. The Ethiopian parliament is powerless, acting as nothing more than a rubber seal to the emperor's whims. \n\nTo the north, Eritreans itch for independence and continue to grow restless, due in part to severe economic downturns which both destroyed our economic progress and paralyzed our government's ability to respond to the needs of its people. With little to no improvement coming to the economic conditions of our Eritrean people, the future looks grim in our beautiful northern shores. Disappointingly yet perhaps predictably, the current depression is causing more unrest than in Eritrea. Our Ethiopian people see the government's inability to fix their problems as a sign of weakness. Not many dare to speak poorly of the Emperor, but many Ethiopians hold a strong itch for change in their hearts. \n\nTo the south, the countless Muslim kingdoms and tribes that our Empire rightfully annexed continue to stir up unrest. The rebelious clans and kings in the south rule, in effect, independent of the dictates of Addis Ababa, for the central government's reach is ineffective at best and harmful at worst. Resources and administration is spread thin, and support for independence grows as we remain paralyzed. \nThe Ethiopian lion is weary and maimed, but as history has proven again and again, we will rise again and claim our rightful golden age."
