BLR_BELARUS_DESC:0 "BLRsia is a defeated nation in 1936.  Having lost many of its holdings in the Treaty of Pinsk, the Tsar found himself increasingly unpopular.  He abdicated and fled to Britain, while a provisional government was created back home.  The socialists pledged support for the new government, and together they wrote a new constitution.  BLRsia is now facing the reprecussions of a poorly-planned invasion to rebellious BelaBLR, and more radical parties are once again on the rise."
