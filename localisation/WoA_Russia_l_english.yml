RUS_Belarus_Question_desc:0 "Belarus has been in a state of constant revolt since the Guerre Mondiale.

russia.1.t:0 "Russia in 1936"
russia.1.d:0 "Following the abdication of Tsar Nicholas and his subsequent escape to Britain in 1917, Russia was ruled by the Provisional Government.  The Petrograd Soviet, who held most allegiances and the real power in Russia, pledged support to the new Provisional Government if they granted certain civil rights to the people and promised to call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.  The Germans denied Lenin’s request to return to the motherland as communism was on the rise in Danubia.  After a four month general-strike-turned-armed-revolt protesting the ongoing war, and under pressure from the Petrograd Soviet, the Duma ruled to make peace with the Germans.  The Treaty of Pinsk saw Russia lose Ukraine, the Baltics, Finland, Poland, and Kamchatka, and in the subsequent turmoil Belarus and Turkestan.  Russia, without the antagonizing force of Lenin, stabilized, and in 1920 a constituent assembly was called to redraw the constitution.  Russia is now ruled by the its president and the Joint Assembly, a two house parliament composed of the Duma and Grand Soviet, successor to the Petrograd Soviet.  The 1925 Assembly election would determine the future of Russia in no small part.  The Bolshevik rhetoric had been largely discredited as many Bolsheviks served in the first Assembly, Duma and Soviet.  Their most prominent leader, Lenin, remained in Switzerland under house arrest.  The fall of the Bolsheviks saw the rise of the more moderate Kadets and Mensheviks, led by an aging Trotsky.  1930 bought similar yields, however many still hold secret allegiances to the Bolshevik faction that are not being shown in this time of relative peace.  The Soviet does most of the day-to-day running of the country, and the Duma handles larger policy decisions, like multi-year infrastructure expansion projects.  Free speech is relatively well known by 1936, as there is almost always someone in government who has your opinions and will make sure they are protected.  Many tsarists must hid their allegiances, however.  Labor unions flourish and have their own seats on the Soviet.  Many more radical reforms have been stopped in the Duma, however, as they remain more conservative.  The 1935 elections have brought the winds of change.  Following the second Byelorussian war, Russia has seen a radicalization of politics, and both Bolsheviks and Populists are on the rise.  More moderate parties attempt to hold steadfast as Russia enters a new age.  How will you guide the motherland through this troublesome time?"
russia.1.a:0 "Into the New Age!"
