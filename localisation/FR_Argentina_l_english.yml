ARG_WoA_DESC:0 "After siding with the Central Powers in the Guerra Mondiale it seemed that the future of Argentina was one of economic growth and glorious peace. However after a long struggle against the Brazilo-Paraguayan alliance in the 1926-1930 Gran Guerra Suramericana, Argentina now suffers immense political and economical instability, which is only worsened that Argentine support is the only reason that Uruguay hasn't collapsed into absolute anarchy yet. With the centrist parties losing support to more radical ideologies, it seems like almost anyone could get to power; be it by being democratically elected in the upcoming 1937 elections, or in a violent revolution."

###National Foci###
ARG_the_uruguayan_question:0 "The Uruguayan Question"
ARG_the_uruguayan_question_desc:0 "Brazilian imperialism threatening the neighbouring country of Uruguay caused a series of conflicts that would, in 1926, escalate into a continent-wide conflict that would be known as the Great South American War. It has now been a decade since the start of the War and groups in both countries are asking for further integration of Uruguay with the Argentine state."

ARG_restore_their_economy:0 "Restore Their Economy"
ARG_restore_their_economy_desc:0 "We've managed to prevent a total collapse of the Uruguayan economy since 1930. However, due to our own economical and political instability, we haven't been able to do much to actually revert the damage done to Uruguay by the Great South American War and the Great Depression. It is time we take action, before another great conflict comes to Europe or South America."

ARG_to_undo_imperialism:0 "To Undo Imperialism"
ARG_to_undo_imperialism_desc:0 "Ever since 1822, the UK tried to influence the newly independent South American countries, so when in 1825 the Rioplatine-Brazilian War started, a British diplomat was sent to mediate. However once it became clear that neither side would give up, it was offered that the Banda Oriental would become an independent state, which the British could easily influence; both sides reluctantly agreed."

ARG_to_unite_our_nation:0 "To Unite Our Nation"
ARG_to_unite_our_nation_desc:0 "Argentinians and Uruguayans not only share an ethnic, religious and cultural origin, but have also evolved in said areas in an almost identical way. Being so similar to eachother, it is only logical that we seek to protect our brothers and sisters on the other shore of the Río de la Plata. After all, why would two groups so similar not want to coexist and collaborate?"

ARG_to_enforce_our_hegemony:0 "To Enforce Our Hegemony"
ARG_to_enforce_our_hegemony_desc:0 "Placeholder"

ARG_to_stop_our_common_enemy:0 "To Stop Our Common Enemy"
ARG_to_stop_our_common_enemy_desc:0 "For over a century Argentinians and Uruguayans alike have lived under the constant fear of having to submit to the Beast of the Amazon. Last time they attacked we had to desesperately organize a defense to hold our ground and push them back. This time we will be ready, we will be waiting for them, together. If we work side, Brazil will threaten us no more. We shall resist and we will be victors."

ARG_denounce_british_favouritism:0 "Denounce British Favouritism"
ARG_denounce_british_favouritism_desc:0 "Altough the English would argue that they were completely fair during the mediation of the Rioplatine-Brazilian war, the fact that the United Kingdom ignored Brazilian slave trade but influenced in the Argentine-Uruguayan civil wars shows a clear favouritism towards Brazil. How can they claim that Uruguay is not a buffer state created by two rotten Empires with a straight face?"

ARG_denounce_brazilian_imperialism:0 "Denounce Brazilian Imperialism"
ARG_denounce_brazilian_imperialism_desc:0 "The Brazilians attacked in 1816 and they attacked again in 1926, however it seems pretty clear that they won't wait until 2036 to attack again. If we do not denounce their expansionist and imperialistic ways, their uncontrollable desire for more land, people and resources to exploit...Then who will?"

ARG_uruguayan_workers_congress:0 "Uruguayan Workers' Congress"
ARG_uruguayan_workers_congress_desc:0 "It is our job as protectors of Uruguay to make sure to bring the worker's revolution to the country. By establishing the Uruguayan Workers' Congress we guarantee that Uruguay will be rid of the oligarchic land-owning bourgeoise that has plagued them since our independence from Spain."

ARG_two-country_nation_theory:0 "The Two-Country Nation Theory"
ARG_two-country_nation_theory_desc:0 "José Félix Uriburu once said "divide not a nation into multiple states for it will sooner or later reunite, stronger than ever before", we must call for the reunification of the Platine nation under a single state, so that we may have the power to defeat our enemies."

ARG_purge_the_traitors:0 "Purge The Traitors"
ARG_purge_the_traitors_desc:0 "Placeholder"

ARG_economical_and_financial_unity:0 "Economical and Financial Unity"
ARG_economical_and_financial_unity_desc:0 "By establishing a common market for several materials used in military production and pooling our defense funds with Uruguay, we can further expand our capability to act jointly in defense of our territory against a theoretical attack from an outside force, be it from Brazil or elsewhere."

ARG_autonomous_region_of_uruguay:0 "The Autonomous Region of Uruguay"
ARG_autonomous_region_of_uruguay_desc:0 "After long-winded debate the majority of the Uruguayan Workers' Congress has reached the conclusion that, for one reason or another, it is for the better of socialism in the region that Argentina integrates Uruguay as an autonomous region. Together we shall further the goals of the worker's revolution." 

ARG_reestablish_the_banda_oriental:0 "Re-Establish the Banda Oriental"
ARG_reestablish_the_banda_oriental_desc:0 "Following a referendum in Uruguay, we have annexed the country and made it our fifteenth province. After over a century, the Banda Oriental has returned to where it rightfully belongs, the Platine nation is united once more; this time nothing and no one will be able to separate us."

This is where we put our foot down, we will not be pushed around anymore. We will push them back to Río where they belong."

ARG_final_stabilization:0 "Final Stabilization"
ARG_final_stabilization_desc:0 "Now that we have integrated Uruguay we must ensure the stability of the region, lest its economy goes into crisis again or the people lose faith in us."
