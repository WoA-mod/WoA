warsan.1.t:0 "The Ethiopian Threat"
warsan.1.d:0 "It seems the Sultan's hopes were too high! The Ethiopian menace has again risen to threaten the people of Warsangali. Reports are flowing in of a successful and brutal campaign to restore stability to Ethiopia, followed immediately by military movements and preparations most obviously aimed to prepare for an invasion of Dervish lands. \n\nWhile the Dervish mean little to Warsangali, this move flared up anxiety in the sultanate. Many suggest that after Dervish lands are conquered by the Ethiopians, the barbaric empire might choose to come next for the Warsangali people."
warsan.1.a:0 "Yet another enemy for us to fight..."
